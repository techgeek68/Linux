## History

---
**Command History**
```bash
history           # Show command history
!number           # Execute command by number. e.g !45 execute command 45 from history
!!                # Execute most recent command
!string           # Execute most recent command starting with 'string' e.g. !c !l
Ctrl+R            # Search history interactively
!ls               # Execute last ls command
history 5               # Show last 5 commands
history | grep string   # Search history for specific commands
```

**History Navigation**

  - Left/Right arrows: Move cursor for editing
  - Home/End: Jump to the beginning/end of the line
  - Ctrl+A: Jump to the beginning of the line
  - Ctrl+E: Jump to the end of the line

**Configuring History**
```bash
# Temporary changes (current session only)
HISTSIZE=100
echo $HISTSIZE

# Permanent changes for current user
# Edit ~/.bashrc and add:
HISTSIZE=2000
# Then reload: source ~/.bashrc

# System-wide changes (root only)
# Edit /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile
```

**History Files and Management:**
  - Current session: Commands are temporarily held in an in-memory buffer, allowing recall only within the current session.
  - Permanent storage: Commands are permanently recorded in ~/.bash_history, preserving historical data across sessions.
  - Each user has a separate history
  - After logout, buffer content appends to `.bash_history`
  - Default history size: 1000 commands (FIFO:First In First Out)

```bash
ls -a                    # Show hidden files including .bash_history
cat .bash_history        # View permanent command history
rm -f .bash_history      # Delete history file
```
