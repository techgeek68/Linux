**Linux Manual Pages**

- A primary source of documentation available on almost every Linux system is the system manual pages, or man pages.
- These pages are distributed with software packages and provide concise, command line accessible documentation via the `man` command.
- The pages are typically stored in subdirectories under `/usr/share/man`.
- Man pages originate from the traditional Unix *Programmer's Manual*. Due to its scope, the manual is divided into numbered sections, each covering a specific type of topic.
- The following table lists the standard sections. Note that section numbers and their order are consistent across most Linux distributions.



| Section | Content Type | Description & Common Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | User Commands | Executable programs and shell commands. (Most frequently used by all users.) |
| **2** | System Calls | Functions provided by the Linux kernel for programs to request services. |
| **3** | Library Functions | Routines provided by program libraries (e.g., the C standard library). |
| **4** | Special Files | Files found in `/dev` (device files) and details on kernel interfaces. |
| **5** | File Formats & Conventions | Syntax and structure of configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/fstab`). |
| **6** | Games | Amusing programs and demos (a historical section). |
| **7** | Overviews, Conventions & Misc. | Miscellaneous topics, including protocols, filesystems, and character sets. |
| **8** | System Administration Commands | Commands used for system maintenance, typically requiring **root** privileges. |
| **9** | Kernel Routines | Internal kernel API documentation (for kernel developers). |

>For system administrators, the most relevant sections are typically **1** (user commands), **5** (file formats), and **8** (administrative commands). Developers often reference sections **2**, **3**, and **9**.

>To distinguish between man pages with the same name in different sections, references include the section number in parentheses (e.g., `passwd(1)` for the command, `passwd(5)` for the file format).

**Accessing Man Pages**

  To view a man page, use the command `man [section_number] command_name`
  
  >The optional section_number specifies which manual section to search

**Basic Syntax:**
```bash
man ssh          # Displays the first matching man page (usually from section 1).
man 5 passwd     # Displays the man page for `passwd` specifically from section 5.
```

> If you omit the section number, `man` searches the sections in their default order (1, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9) and displays the first match.

**Example: Viewing the `ssh` Man Page**
```bash
man ssh
```

**Navigating and Searching Within a Man Page**

  - Man pages are viewed through a pager program (usually `less`). Mastering navigation is essential for efficient use.


**Standard Man Page Structure**

  - While not every page contains all headings, they generally follow a consistent organisation:

| Heading | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NAME** | The command or topic name with a one line description. |
| **SYNOPSIS** | A summary of the command syntax. Optional arguments are in `[brackets]`. |
| **DESCRIPTION** | A detailed explanation of the command or topic's purpose and operation. |
| **OPTIONS** | Descriptions of each command line flag and argument. |
| **EXAMPLES** | Practical examples of usage (not present in all pages). |
| **FILES** | Lists related system files and directories. |
| **SEE ALSO** | References to other related commands, files, or man pages. |
| **BUGS** | Known limitations or issues. |
| **AUTHOR** | Information about the writer(s) or maintainer(s). |

**Navigation Commands**
| Keystroke | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Spacebar` or `Page Down` or `f` | Scroll forward one screen. |
| `Page Up` or `b` | Scroll backward one screen. |
| `Down Arrow` or `j` / `Up Arrow` or `k` | Scroll one line down/up. |
| `d` / `u` | Scroll down/up one half screen. |
| `/` followed by a `string` | Search **forward** for the specified string. |
| `?` followed by a `string` | Search **backward** for the specified string. |
| `n` | Repeat the last search in the **same** direction. |
| `N` (Shift+n) | Repeat the last search in the **opposite** direction. |
| `Home` or `g` / `G` or `END` | Go to the **beginning** / **end** of the man page. |
| `q` | **Quit** the viewer and return to the shell prompt. |

> **Searching:** Man pages use the `less` pager, which supports **regular expressions** in searches. Be cautious when searching for strings containing special regex metacharacters (like `.`, `*`, `$`, `^`, `\`). For details, see `man 7 regex`.

**Searching for Man Pages by Keyword**
You often need to find which man page contains information on a specific topic.

**Keyword Search in Titles and Descriptions**

- The `-k` option (or the `apropos` command) searches the **NAME** and **short description** fields of all man pages for a keyword.

```bash
$ man -k passwd       # Find all commands related to "passwd"
```
```bash
man -k copy          # Find all commands related to "copy"
man -k "copy file"   # More specific search

# If you get "nothing appropriate", the manual database needs updating
sudo mandb           # Update the manual database (requires root)
```
> The `whatis` command performs a similar, stricter search that matches only the NAME field.

**Full Text Search Within Man Pages**
The `-K` (capital K) option performs a full text search through the entire content of every man page. This is resource-intensive and can take a significant amount of time on large systems.

- When a match is found, `man` displays that page. You are then presented with a prompt to:
  * Press `Enter` to view the page.
  * Press `Ctrl+d` to skip to the next match.
  * Press `Ctrl+c` to quit the search entirely.

```bash
$ man -K passwd

--Man-- next: cut(1) [ view (return) | skip (Ctrl+D) | quit (Ctrl+C) ]

# User presses Ctrl+D to skip
--Man-- next: chage(1) [ view (return) | skip (Ctrl+D) | quit (Ctrl+C) ]

# User presses Ctrl+C to quit the search
```

**Search within all sections:**
```
man -a printf        # Show all manual pages for 'printf' across sections
```

**Examples** 
  - Finding Sort Options
    - Suppose you want to list files in /etc sorted by size:
```
# Start by checking the manual
man ls

# Search for sorting options
/sort
# Press 'n' to cycle through matches

# Found sorting option: -S sorts by size
ls -lS /etc           # Largest to smallest
ls -lSr /etc          # Smallest to largest (reverse)
ls -lSh /etc          # Human readable sizes
ls -lShr /etc         # Human readable, reversed
```

**Using the `info` Command**

  - The `info` command provides structured, hyperlinked documentation that's often more detailed than `man` pages. Not all commands have `info` documentation.

**Basic Syntax**
```bash
info command_name
```

Example
```bash
info useradd
```

**Navigation in `info` Pages**

| Key | Action |
|-----|---------|
| **Arrow Keys** | Navigate through menu entries |
| **Enter** | Select menu entry or subtopic |
| **Tab** | Jump to next hyperlink |
| **n** | Go to next node |
| **p** | Go to previous node |
| **u** | Move up to parent node |
| **/** | Search within document |
| **s** | Start incremental search |
| **q** | Quit |

**Searching in `info`**
  1. Press `/` to enter search mode
  2. Type your search term and press **Enter**
  3. Use **n** to find next occurrence, **N** for previous

---

**Using the `--help` Option**

  - Most commands support a `--help` or `-h` flag that provides quick usage information without opening full documentation.

**Syntax**
```bash
command_name --help
command_name -h
```

**Examples**
```bash
ls --help
yum --help
systemctl --help
```

**Note:** Some commands (particularly those written for older UNIX systems) may use `-?` or other flags instead of `--help`. The `--help` option is standard for GNU utilities.

**Local Documentation Files**
  - Linux systems store additional documentation in `/usr/share/doc/`.

**Accessing Local Documentation**

1. **Navigate to documentation directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/doc
   ```

2. **List available documentation:**
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

3. **Browse specific package documentation:**
   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/doc/httpd    # Apache HTTP Server docs
   ls
   ```

**Viewing Documentation Files**

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `less README` | Scroll through documentation (press `q` to quit) |
| `cat README` | Display entire file at once |
| `grep "keyword" README` | Search for specific information |
| `head -20 README` | View first 20 lines |
| `tail -20 README` | View last 20 lines |

---

**Access via Web Browser**

You can also view documentation files in a web browser:
```
file:///usr/share/doc
```

Or for a specific package:
```
file:///usr/share/doc/httpd
```

> The exact path may vary between distributions. Some systems use `/usr/doc/` or `/usr/local/share/doc/`.

**Effective Help Searching**

   - Use `--help` for quick reference, `man` for detailed explanation, and `info` for comprehensive documentation.
   - Search the manual database:
   ```bash
   apropos network    # Alternative to 'man -k network'
   whatis ls          # Brief description of what a command does
   ```
   - Use command specific help:
   ```bash
   git help           # Git has its own help system
   vim :help          # Vim's built in help
   ```
    - Check for examples:
   ```bash
   man -P cat command_name | grep -A5 "EXAMPLE"
   ```

    - Update regularly. Keep your documentation current:
   ```bash
   # On Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install man-db manpages
   
   # On RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
   sudo yum install man-pages
   sudo mandb
   ```
