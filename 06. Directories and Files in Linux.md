## Directories and Files in Linux

In Linux, everything is treated as a file, including directories, devices, and sockets. This unified filesystem approach provides a consistent interface for system interaction. Understanding the directory structure and file management is fundamental to Linux administration and usage.

**File Types in Linux**

**- Regular Files**(`-`)
  - These are standard files such as text files, binary executables, and data files.
  - Represented by `-` at the beginning of the permission string in the `ls -l` output.

**- Directories**(`d`)
  - Special files that act as containers for other files and provide a hierarchical structure in the file system.
  - Represented by `d` in the `ls -l` output.

**- Special File Types**

| **Type**            | **Symbol** | **Description**                                             |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Symbolic Link**    | `l`       | A pointer or shortcut to another file or directory.          |
| **Character Device** | `c`       | Used for unbuffered device access, such as a keyboard or serial port. |
| **Block Device**     | `b`       | Used for buffered device access, such as hard drives or other block storage devices. |
| **Named Pipe**       | `p`       | Enables inter-process communication (IPC) through a persistent data channel. |
| **Socket**           | `s`       | Facilitates communication between processes, either over a network or locally. |


1. **File Type Identification**: The value displayed in the first column in the `ls -l` output signifies the file type.
   - Example: The output `-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Dec 4 10:00 textfile.txt` starts with `-`, indicating a regular file.

2. **Symbolic Links**: Symbolic links (`l`) are especially useful for creating shortcuts or pointers to files or directories without duplicating them.

3. **Devices**:
   - **Character Devices (`c`)** and **Block Devices (`b`)** provide a way to interact with hardware through the virtual file system. Character devices communicate in streams (e.g., keyboard input), while block devices interact with data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., reading from a disk).
   
4. **Inter process Communication**:
   - **Named Pipes (`p`)** serve as a FIFO (First In, First Out) data buffer between processes.
   - **Sockets (`s`)** are powerful tools for creating network programs, enabling processes to communicate over TCP/IP or locally.

**Directory**

A directory in Linux is a special file type (identified as `d` in the `ls -l` output) that serves as an organisational unit for managing the hierarchical namespace of the file system. It contains entries that map filenames to inodes, which store the metadata and location of files or subdirectories.
  - A directory has its own inode `ls -i`, permissions, and attributes.
  - It enables efficient organisation, navigation (cd, pwd), and management of files and subdirectories.

- Directory Entries

     - . (dot): Self-reference (inode number of current directory)
     - .. (dot-dot): Parent directory reference

 - Directory Inode Structure
   - i_mode: File type + permissions (File type (040000) + permissions (0700) = 040700 octal)
   - i_links_count: Hard link count (e.g. Hard link count (15 = 2 + 13 subdirectories))
   - i_size: Directory size in bytes, usually a multiple of block size(e.g. 4096)
   - i_dev: Major/minor device number where inode resides (Device: 253,0)
   - i_blocks: Data blocks allocated (e.g. 8, Number of 512-byte blocks allocated)
   - i_ctime: Directory entry modification time

**Creating and Managing Directories**

  - Use the mkdir command to create directories
> Note: Directories are created in your current working directory by default. Use pwd to check your current location.
```bash
# Create a single directory
mkdir dir_name

# Examples
mkdir impfiles
mkdir project_files
```

- Changing Directories
  - Navigate between directories using cd:
```
cd impfiles           # Enter a directory
pwd                   # Verify current location
cd ..                 # Go back one level (parent directory)
cd                    # Return to home directory
cd -                  # Toggle between the last two directories
```

- Hidden Directories
  - Files and directories starting with . are hidden in Linux:
```bash
mkdir .newdir         # Create hidden directory
ls                    # Regular listing (won't show hidden)
ls -a                 # Show all files, including hidden
cd .newdir            # Access hidden directory
```

- Directories with Special Characters
  - Handle names containing spaces or special characters:
    
    - Using quotes:
```bash
mkdir "New Folder"
mkdir "Red Hat Certification"
cd "New Folder"
```
    - Using escape sequences:
```bash
mkdir Red\ Hat\ Certification
```

- Creating Multiple Directories
```
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3                    # Multiple directories at once
mkdir dir{30,35,90}                    # Specific names using braces
mkdir dir{20..60}                      # Range of 40 directories
rm -rf dir{20..60}                     # Remove multiple directories
```

- Nested Directory Structures
  - Method 1 - Sequential creation:
```bash
mkdir dir1
cd dir1
mkdir dir2
cd dir2
mkdir dir3
```

  - Method 2 - Using -p flag (creates parent directories automatically):
    - The -p option creates parent directories if they don't exist.
```bash
mkdir -p dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4
```

  - Advanced Directory Creation with Brace Expansion
```bash
# Multiple subdirectories at different levels
mkdir -p software/{Development,Operation,Support}

# Complex nested structure
mkdir -p training/linux/{rhcsa,rhce}
mkdir -p training/oracle/{oca,ocp}
mkdir -p training/devops/{ansible,kubernetes,cloud/{aws,azure,gc}}

# Combined example
mkdir -p certification/{linux/{rhcsa,rhce},oracle/{oca,ocp},devops/{ansible,kubernetes,cloud/{aws,azure,gc}}}
```

- Creating Complex Directory Structures
  - Create
```text 
certification/
├── devops
│   ├── ansible
│   ├── cloud
│   │   ├── aws
│   │   ├── azure
│   │   └── gcp
│   └── kubernetes
├── linux
│   ├── rhce
│   └── rhcsa
└── oracle
    ├── oca
    └── ocp
``` 
```bash
# Create nested directory structure in one command
mkdir -p ~/certification/{linux/{rhcsa,rhce},oracle/{oca,ocp},devops/{ansible,kubernetes,cloud/{aws,azure,gcp}}}
```
