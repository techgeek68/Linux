## Registering Systems

---
Registering RHEL systems with Red Hat is essential to access software updates, security patches, and support services through the subscription based model.

**Red Hat Developer Subscription**

- Red Hat offers a free subscription for a large number of its products via the Red Hat Developer program at https://developer.redhat.com.
- Using a Red Hat Developer Subscription, developers can rapidly develop, prototype, test, and demonstrate their applications on the same Red Hat software as used on production systems.

- Create a personal account at https://access.redhat.com, then sign up for the Red Hat Developer Subscription program.
- You may use an existing personal account, but not one associated with any organization's support subscription.
- The Red Hat Developer Subscription is self supported, but the product is updated regularly.

**Subscription Model: Simple Content Access (SCA)**
- **SCA** validates subscriptions at the organization level (no need to attach to individual systems)
- Managed via [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console](console.redhat.com)
- Provides access to:
  - Software repositories and updates
  - Red Hat Insights analytics
  - Knowledgebase and support
  - Security patches and bug fixes

**Registration Methods**

**1. Using `rhc` Command (Recommended)**
- For RHEL 8.8 and later systems
- Single command enables multiple services:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install rhc
  ```
  ```bash
  sudo rhc connect
  ```
- Automatically enables:
  - Content repositories
  - Red Hat Insights analytics
  - Remote management capabilities

**2. Using Activation Keys (For Automation)**
- More secure - no personal credentials required
- Create keys in Hybrid Cloud Console:
  - Set release version
  - Define system purpose tags
  - Pre-configure repositories
- Registration command:
  ```bash
  sudo rhc connect --activation-key <key_name> --organization <org_ID>
  ```
